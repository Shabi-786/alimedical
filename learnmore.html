        Top 5 Exercises You Can Do At Home
        Doing exercises at home can be a lot more beneficial than going to a gym. Giving your 100% effort while
        exercising at home can give you better results if you are not comfortable exercising at the gym.

        Also, when you work out at home, you will use your own space for changing & freshening. It’s much more hygienic
        and gives you more privacy and a level of comfort.

        Here are a few exercises you can easily perform at home and can stay fit & healthy.

        1. Lunges
        Challenging your balance is an essential part of a well-rounded exercise routine. Lunges do just that, promoting
        functional movement while also increasing strength in your legs and glutes.

        Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms down at your sides.
        Take a step forward with your right leg and bend your right knee as you do so, stopping when your thigh is
        parallel to the ground. Ensure that your right knee doesn’t extend past your right foot.
        Push up off your right foot and return to the starting position. Repeat with your left leg. This is one rep.
        Complete 3 sets of 10 reps daily.
        2. Pushups
        Pushups are one of the most basic yet effective bodyweight moves you can perform because of the number of
        muscles that are recruited to perform them.

        Start in a plank position. Your core should be tight, shoulders pulled down and back, and your neck neutral.
        Bend your elbows and begin to lower your body down to the floor. When your chest grazes it, extend your elbows
        and return to the start. Focus on keeping your elbows close to your body during the movement.
        Complete 3 sets of as many reps as possible.
        3. Squats
        Squats increase lower body and core strength, as well as flexibility in your lower back and hips. Because they
        engage some of the largest muscles in the body, they also pack a major punch in terms of calories burned.

        Start by standing straight, with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and your arms at your
        sides.
        Brace your core and, keeping your chest and chin up, push your hips back and bend your knees as if you’re going
        to sit in a chair.
        Ensuring your knees don’t bow inward or outward, drop down until your thighs are parallel to the ground,
        bringing your arms out in front of you in a comfortable position. Pause for 1 second, then extend your legs and
        return to the starting position.
        Complete 3 sets of 20 reps daily.
        4. Jumping Jacks
        Jumping jacks are the best cardio exercises. There are various benefits of including it in your everyday
        exercise program.

        Stand straight with your feet together and hands on your sides. Jump along by raising your arms above your head
        and bringing your feet apart. Reverse the movement immediately and come back to the original position. Start
        doing it faster.
        Do it as many times as you can.


        5. Planks
        Planks are an effective way to target both your abdominal muscles and your whole body. Planking stabilizes your
        core without straining your back the way sit-ups or crunches might.

        Begin in a pushup position with your hand and toes firmly planted on the ground, your back straight, and your
        core tight.
        Keep your chin slightly tucked and your gaze just in front of your hands.
        Take deep, controlled breaths while maintaining tension throughout your entire body, so your abs, shoulders,
        triceps, glutes, and quads are all engaged.
        Complete 2-3 sets of 30-second holds to start.
        These fundamental exercises will do your body good, but there’s always room to keep pushing it. If you notice
        yourself breezing through and barely breaking a sweat, focus on progressive overload by making each move more
        challenging by adding more sets of reps and weights.

        Working out at home can give you impressive results when you exercise regularly and follow an effective home
        workout plan. So, make exercise a part of your daily routine and you will be surprised to see the amazing
        results in just a few weeks.</p>
        <h2>ABOUT MONKEY POX</h2>
       <P> Symptoms of Monkeypox:
        Monkeypox symptoms are more or less similar to those of smallpox. Fever, headache, muscle aches, and tiredness are the first monkeypox symptoms. The fundamental distinction between smallpox and monkeypox symptoms is that monkeypox causes swollen lymph nodes, but smallpox does not. Monkeypox has a week or two incubation period from infection to symptoms, although it can be as short as a few days to a few weeks.
        
        Fever/Headache
        Muscle pain
        Backache
        Swollen Lymph nodes
        Chills/Exhaustion
        contagious
        The patient develops a monkeypox rash for 1 to 3 days (sometimes longer) following the onset of fever, which usually starts on the face and spreads to other regions of the body.
        
        Precaution:
        The first and major monkeypox precaution to keep in mind is isolation. If you have been in contact with someone who is showing monkeypox symptoms or has gotten it, you must isolate yourself.
        
        Isolated individuals are suspected of having monkeypox in a negative atmospheric environment. Patients should be placed in a private examination room if a negative air pressure room is not available. If neither of these options is practically doable, care should be taken to limit exposure to others in the immediate vicinity. These monkeypox precautions could include wearing a surgical mask covering your nose and mouth (if tolerated) and covering any exposed skin infections with a sheet or gown.
        
        Other monkeypox precautions include:
        
        Hand hygiene should be practiced after any interaction with an infected patient and/or their environment while providing care.
        Containment and disposal of contaminated waste (e.g., dressings).
        Avoid contact with clothing material of affected person, when handling laundry (e.g., bedding, towels, personal apparel.
        Handle used patient-care equipment with caution to avoid contamination of skin and clothing.
        Transmission:
        When a person comes into contact with the monkeypox virus from an animal, human, or contaminated objects, the virus is transmitted. The virus enters the body through torn/infected skin, the respiratory tract, or mucous membranes even if they are not apparent like eyes, nose, or mouth. Bite or scratch, bush meat preparation, direct contact with bodily fluids or lesion material, or indirect contact with lesion material, such as through contaminated bedding, are all possible methods of animal-to-human transmission. Large respiratory droplets are assumed to be the primary mode of human-to-human transmission. Because respiratory droplets can only reach a few feet, prolonged face-to-face contact is essential. Direct contact with body fluids or lesion material, as well as indirect contact through clothing, are other human-to-human transmission mechanisms.
        
        Treatment:
        There is currently no approved treatment for monkeypox virus infections except for the smallpox vaccine. On the other hand, antivirals developed for smallpox patients may be beneficial. The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) currently has the following medical treatments available for the treatment of monkeypox disease:
        
        Tecovirimat (also known as TPOXX) is an FDA-approved antiviral drug.
        Cidofovir (also known as Vistide) is an FDA-approved antiviral medication.
        The FDA approved Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (VIGIV).
        Prevention:
        Monkeypox prevention can be done in the following ways:
        
        Prevent coming into contact with animals that may be infected with the virus. This includes animals that are sick or that have been found dead in areas where monkeypox disease has been spread.
        Avoid touching any objects that come into contact with a sick animal, such as bedding.
        Keep infectious patients separate from those who could become infected.
        After coming into contact with infected animals or humans, wash your hands thoroughly with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or soap.

        <H3>STRESS CAN AGRATIVE STOMACH PROBLEM</H3> 
        <p>What kind of gastric diseases are common in Pakistan?

            Hepatitis is alarmingly high in the country. Peptic ulcer, diarrhea, TB of the small intestine, and gaseous problems are also common. Also, over-the-counter painkillers are a major cause of stomach ulcers.
            
            What precautionary measures should be taken to prevent gastric diseases in summer?
            
            Firstly, drink clean and safe water. There is an unhealthy trend in our country that while traveling, people prefer to drink and eat from roadside hotels and vendors. This is a risky behavior as most lack the concept of hygiene. Dirty utensils are continuously dipped into a tub filled with contaminated and reused water. Food is then served in so-called “washed crockery” which becomes a cause of Hepatitis A, E, and some diarrheal diseases. People associated with preparing and serving food should be educated about hand washing, crockery washing, and the protection of foods from bees, dust, and other harmful elements.
            
            Why does heartburn occur?
            
            Heartburn is basically an acidity of the stomach that usually occurs because of our eating habits. Overeating, eating without hunger, untimely meals, and spicy and fat-rich foods are some basic reasons which cause the problem. Junk foods also provide easy ground for heartburn.
            
            Which foods should be avoided to prevent acidity?
            
            Avoid foods that aggravate acidity in the stomach. These include tea, coffee, chocolates, tobacco, paan, chaliya, gutka, soft drinks, and citrus fruits. The more you avoid them the less acid will be produced in the stomach.
            
            What is the cause of stomach ulcers?
            
            Approximately 90 percent of people suffering from gastric issues are affected by H Pylori bacteria. This occurs because of poor hygiene and contaminated water. When this bacterium goes into the stomach, it infects it and causes ulcers. A healthy and clean environment and food have a great role in preventing this disease. Ulcer patients may experience severe pain in the stomach and have reduced appetite. Vomiting with blood and black stool are also other symptoms.
            
            Are home remedies effective in treating ulcers?
            
            Some patients drink a mixture of one portion of milk with three portions of water on an empty stomach. Because milk is alkaline in nature it neutralizes the acid in the stomach and relieves the patient from acidity and pain in the stomach. However, home remedies are not a substitute for regular treatment.
            
            Why does the belly bloat?
            
            Our stomach usually bloats or swells after taking a meal. But it can bloat otherwise as well.
            
            People with weak muscles like diabetic patients, obese and people with a sedentary lifestyle are more likely to suffer from this problem. Immediately going to bed after a meal can also cause bloating. Regular exercise or walk after a meal can help control it. Medicines help increase gut movement which results in fast digestion and stopping the belly from bloat.
            
            What is Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?
            
            Irritable bowel syndrome is the sensitivity of the gut which is the response of the intestine against stress. It is of two types. One has symptoms of diarrhea and the other has constipation. People who suffer from this condition have hyper-sensitive gut which can be triggered easily. Common symptoms of IBS include cramping, abdominal pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea or constipation, or both. Symptoms can be controlled by managing diet, lifestyle, and stress. Otherwise, consult a specialist as IBS is a chronic disease. Medicines can help control the problem.
            
            What are the common causes of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)?
            
            Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a condition where stomach acid persistently and regularly flows up into the food pipe. Occasional acid reflux is quite common, often occurring as a result of overeating, lying down after eating, or eating particular foods. However, recurrent acid reflux, diagnosed as GERD, typically has other causes and risk factors. It occurs when the sphincter muscle at the bottom of the esophagus becomes weak, or opens when it should not.
            
            Who is at risk of experiencing GERD?
            
            GERD occurs more commonly in people who are: overweight or obese because of increased pressure on the abdomen. Pregnant women, due to the same increased pressure. Patients who are on certain medications, including asthma, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines, sedatives, and antidepressants can also suffer from the problem. Smokers or passive smokers may also experience it.
            
            Which foods and habits can ruin the stomach?
            
            Fat-rich and over-fried foods can have bad effects on the stomach. The majority of people do not eat a balanced diet. For example, an average person’s meal comprises more cereals like wheat and rice as compared to meat and vegetables. In a healthy diet, these things should be in a balanced proportion. Meals prepared with the Chinese method are healthier. As far as habits are concerned, some people eat their favorite foods in large portions. This should be avoided. Also, avoid going to bed immediately after taking a meal. Moreover, overuse of pain killers is highly damaging to the stomach. They should only be taken only with a doctor’s advice.
            
            How can constipation be prevented?
            
            Nowadays, constipation is as common a problem as excessive weight. The absence of fiber in our diets is a major cause. Processed and refined foods are also responsible for it. People usually do not take enough salads and vegetables which results in less fiber consumption and eventually results in constipation.
            
            How can we avoid common stomach problems?
            
            Take timely meals. Diets should be simple and easily digestible. Avoid taking rich-fried and spicy foods. Include vegetables and salads instead. If you are facing a liver or stomach problem, consult the concerned doctor immediately.
            
            What is the role of green tea indigestion? What is the right time to take it?
            
            Green tea is a healthy drink and is rich in antioxidants. It helps in digesting the food so it is better to have it after a meal.
            
            Do depression and anxiety affect the stomach and cause indigestion?
            
            Anxiety is not a direct cause though it does indirectly affect it. Stress or anxiety aggravates the symptoms in people with stomach problems particularly patients with gas problems, dysphasia, or irritable bowel.</p>
